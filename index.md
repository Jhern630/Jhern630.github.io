### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, "Hello World!" was my favorite because it was the first time I had ever programmed something. Although very simple, it was the start of my programming "adventure" this semester.

* Lab 4 Part 2

    Lab 4, part 2, was my favorite because it was my first time programming a "game" called Hi-low. This lab was also the first time using if statements, essential to making a game like Hi-low.

* Lab 5 Part 1

    Lab 5, part 1, was my favorite because we had to use if statements and arguments to create a Madlib. In the lab, we had to use sandwich ingredients to make the Madlib. This lab was fun because I learned how to use arguments.
